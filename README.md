# ITRex-Lab-Project
This project will create an electronic doctor's waiting list. The project includes the creation of two websites with working functionality and the connection of databases.

How to use it? Open the current directory in your terminal and type the command "npm start". Then open your browser and click on the following links:
  1) http://localhost:3000/client.html
  2) http://localhost:3000/clinic.html
  
Then emulate the doctor and the patient and watch the result :) 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me on the discord
